# Some random example:
#rest.config.directory=/tmp/oai-dashboard_rest/

# When using docker-compose, the '.oai-dashboard' folder of the user home directory automatically gets mounted
# to '/root/.oai-dashboard', so any files that are in '~/.oai-dashboard' of the host system can be accessed from there
# this is a way to share the configuration between host and guest (guest = docker container)
#rest.config.directory=/root/.oai-dashboard
